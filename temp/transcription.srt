 Thank you very much.

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,200
 Okay, let's get straight into the tutorial and I will teach you how to introduce yourself

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,560
 during a job interview.

13
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,240
 So within this presentation, I am going to cover three things.

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,359
 First of all, I will give you some essential tips for getting your job interview

15
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:48,960
 off to a flying start.

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,960
 I will then tell you the four simple things you must include

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,760
 within your job interview introduction.

18
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:00,399
 And I will then give you an example scripted interview introduction

19
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,519
 that you can use at the start of your interview.

20
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:06,560
 Essential tip number one, forgetting your interview

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,319
 after a flying start is to focus on creating a positive first impression.

22
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:16,400
 And you can do that by arriving at the interview venue

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,200
 20 minutes before the interview starts.

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,400
 This shows that you are punctual and you are organized.

25
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:28,320
 Now when you arrive at the interview venue, make sure you read your job interview introduction

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,360
 which I will give to you in a second and also reread the job description.

27
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,000
 Because by reading these important documents, it gets you relaxed and composed

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,920
 and it makes sure that you are prepared for what's to come during your interview.

29
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,200
 Essential tip number two, forgetting your interview

30
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,920
 after a flying start is to make sure that you dress professionally.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,480
 How you dress says a lot about your intentions for this job.

32
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,480
 And if you haven't dressed professionally, what does it say to the interviewer?

33
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,560
 Well, it tells the interviewer that you don't care and you can't be bothered.

34
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,719
 And therefore, why should they hire you?

35
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,159
 So make sure you dress professionally for your interview because it says an awful lot

36
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:12,240
 about your intentions for this role.

37
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,719
 An essential tip number three is to make sure that throughout the interview,

38
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:22,159
 you have good posture, you smile and you demonstrate really good manners.

39
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,280
 This is important.

40
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,240
 And how can you demonstrate good manners during your interview?

41
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,719
 Well, right at the very start, when you first meet the interviewer, say this.

42
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,120
 Hi, my name is Richard and I'm here today for the interview.

43
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,159
 Thank you very much.

44
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,919
 So just by saying that, demonstrate really good manners and don't forget,

45
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:44,000
 do not sit down in the interview chair until invited to do so.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,879
 So once you're sat down in the interview chair, the interviewer is going to say something like,

47
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,719
 welcome to the interview.

48
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:53,360
 Can you start off by introducing yourself?

49
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,840
 Or they might say, tell me about yourself.

50
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,120
 Now, whenever you introduce yourself during an interview,

51
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,400
 it's really important that you include the following four things.

52
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,840
 Please make sure you take notes.

53
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,319
 Number one, talk about the skills and qualities you have that are a match for the role you are

54
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,519
 applying for.

55
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:18,799
 Number two, talk about any experience or qualifications you possess that are relevant to the position.

56
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:25,039
 Number three, talk about any significant achievements you have gained in work,

57
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,280
 life or personal life so far.

58
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,799
 And then finally, number four, talk about the type of person you are and what you are going to do

59
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,120
 in the role if they hire you.

60
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,159
 So you should include those four things when introducing yourself during a job interview.

61
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,280
 And right now, I am going to give you a brilliant job interview introduction script

62
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,079
 that you can use right at the start of your interview.

63
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:51,359
 So when the interviewer says to you, introduce yourself.

64
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:53,519
 Here's a brilliant script that you can use.

65
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:53,919
 Here we go.

66
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,879
 Thank you for giving me the opportunity to be interviewed for this position today.

67
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,519
 Now, having studied the job description, I am confident I have the skills,

68
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,680
 the qualities and the qualifications needed to excel in the role.

69
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,439
 I am a fast learner.

70
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:15,199
 I possess excellent problem solving capabilities and I can manage a significant workload.

71
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,839
 I have an impressive track record of achievement.

72
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:24,319
 For example, in my previous role, I was praised by my supervisor for helping the company find

73
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:28,800
 ways to increase sales by improving customer service standards.

74
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,720
 Now, the type of person I am means I will always act as a positive role model for the company.

75
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,240
 And I will make sure I take responsibility for my ongoing professional development.

76
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,760
 Now, if you hire me in this position, I believe you will quickly see a positive return on your

77
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:52,720
 investment. That is a brilliant example of a job interview introduction that you can use
